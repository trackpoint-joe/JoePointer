# Before/After Content Examples

## Example 1: Operating Principle #1

### BEFORE (250 words)
```
1. Design for Adoption, Not Just Launch

What it means: A great solution that nobody uses isn't a solution. Success isn't measured at rollout—it's measured by sustained use.

How I operationalize it: In Workplace Modernization, I reduced real estate footprint by 44%—a change that typically destroys morale. Instead, I architected adoption into every layer: launched a Job Shadowing Program (made change feel like opportunity), built a Culture Champions Network (2,000+ associates invested in success), and drove recognitions UP 395% (proved culture could thrive during efficiency). The result: smooth transition with minimal backlash.

In CareerSpark, I applied the same principle: designed prompts that helped a 27-year associate see her value (not technical jargon), created a Manager Guide before launch (not after), ran roadshows reaching 1,500+ people directly. Result: 16,000+ at scale.

The proof: Workplace Modernization achieved 44% footprint reduction without retention crisis. CareerSpark reached 16,000+ associates and integrated into TIAA University as a core career development experience.

## Example 2: CareerSpark - The Challenge Section

### BEFORE (180 words)
```
The Challenge

TIAA's 16,000+ associates faced more than a technology or training problem.

The situation:
• Two major office closures affecting 1,000+ associates, many with 15-27 years in the same role
• Limited visibility into their transferable skills beyond current job titles
• Development plans that felt like guesswork—shooting in the dark without clear targets

The compounding factors:
• AI tools were being rolled out across the company, but:
  - Training was highly technical and aimed at specialists
  - Most associates didn't see AI as "for people like them"
  - Trust in AI was low; anxiety about the future was high

The real problem wasn't just "we need to upskill people." It was: How do we help thousands of people facing uncertainty see their own value clearly, chart a path forward, and learn to use AI in a way that feels relevant and empowering?

## Example 3: Workplace Modernization - Key Projects

### BEFORE (220 words with 4 subsections)
```
Key Projects

Charlotte Campus Welcome (2022)
• Hosted 6 in-person tour events with leadership greetings, campus tours, training, meals
• Changed skepticism into excitement; showed that cultural investment was part of the modernization

Lewisville Digital Displays (2022)
• CEO-directed 2-week refresh; installed 12 digital displays for recognition, announcements, and hybrid huddles
• Innovation became repeatable: replicated in Denver and Charlotte; later became business requirement for Frisco

Denver Consolidation & Modernization (2023-2024)
• 700 associates transitioning from assigned to hoteling seating; floor optimization achieved 44% more efficient space utilization
• Most resistive change; I volunteered to attend townhalls and answer every concern
• Used honesty + empathy: "I don't like this either. I'm going through it too. But we need to do this together."
• Result: minimal unexpected turnover; concerns addressed
• Note: This efficiency consolidation is separate from the Denver office closure announced for 2026

Frisco Corporate Center Opening (2024)
• 500+ associates moved into new 15-story building; largest modernization undertaking
• Negotiated special call center configuration (facing inward toward displays for team cohesion)
• Recognized as "Change Champion" for adoption leadership

## Example 4: Revolver - My Role Section

### BEFORE (110 words with bullets)
```
My Role: Knowledge Architect + Translator

I wasn't just building software. I was architecting how enterprises should think about knowledge structure.

My unique blend of skills:
• Knowledge Architecture: Structured content so it could be reused, recombined, and repurposed without breaking context or meaning
• Instructional Design: Built learning science into the content structure itself
• UX Design: Made structured thinking easy, not bureaucratic, through intuitive interfaces
• Global Trainer & Sales Engineer: Traveled the world teaching enterprises not just how to use Revolver, but how to think differently about knowledge as organizational infrastructure

## Key Patterns in Content Reduction

### 1. Remove Redundant Headers
- **Before**: "What it means:" + "How I operationalize it:" + "The proof:"
- **After**: Core message + expandable details

### 2. Convert Bullets to Flowing Text
- **Before**: 4-5 bullet points with full sentences
- **After**: Single paragraph with parenthetical details

### 3. Merge Subsections
- **Before**: Multiple h4 headers with separate sections
- **After**: Single section with paragraph per topic

### 4. Remove Explanatory Setup
- **Before**: "The original ask was..." + "Very quickly, I saw two truths..."
- **After**: Jump straight to the insight

### 5. Consolidate Examples
- **Before**: Multiple detailed examples with full context
- **After**: One strong example + brief mention of others

### 6. Use Expandable Sections for Details
- **Before**: All details visible by default
- **After**: Core message visible, details on demand

## User Journey Comparison

### BEFORE: Linear Read
```
User lands → Reads everything → 25 minutes → Exhausted → May not reach contact page
```

### AFTER: Choose Your Own Adventure
```
Quick Scanner:
User lands → Scans visible content → 90 seconds → Decides interest → Contacts or leaves

Deep Diver:
User lands → Scans visible content → 90 seconds → Interested → Expands sections → 8-12 minutes → Contacts

Targeted Reader:
User lands → Scans visible content → 90 seconds → Expands 2-3 relevant sections → 4-6 minutes → Contacts
```
