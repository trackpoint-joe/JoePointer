EXECUTIVE PROFILE

Most transformations fail at adoption. I design and lead enterprise-scale initiatives where systems, workplaces, and AI tools are built with humans at the center, so change feels intentional, not imposed. At TIAA, I conceived and launched CareerSpark, an AI-powered career platform that's now integrated into the enterprise learning portal. I've led workplace transformations affecting 700+ associates (44% footprint reduction) and culture programs driving 306% increases in engagement.
